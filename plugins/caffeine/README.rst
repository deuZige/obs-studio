Caffeine Plugin
===============

NOTE: This is still an experimental proof-of-concept work-in-progress.

To build OBS with caffeine support, before running cmake:

 - Follow instructions for [building caffeine-rtc](https://github.com/caffeinetv/caffeine-rtc/blob/master/README.md)
 - Add a CaffeinePath variable to your environment or cmake properties pointing to the caffeine-rtc checkout directory

TODO: libcaffeine will be available as a precompiled library in the future
